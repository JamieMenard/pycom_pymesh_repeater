# Pymesh micropython code

This is mostly vanilla pymesh code with the addition of multicast messaging
and a software restart trigger if something goes wrong and a mesh connection
doesn't happen.

This project exemplifies the use of Pycom's proprietary LoRa Mesh network - **Pymesh**.
These scripts were created and tested on Lopy4 and Fipy, using the Pymesh binary release.
